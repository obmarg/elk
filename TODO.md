### Must have

- Documentation
- Logging python processes
- Tests, if I can figure out how best to write them.

### Good stuff

- Better taks failure handling
  - Backoff on failing tasks
  - Store details of fully failed tasks

### Nice to have

- Add a deadline to python tasks, co-ordinated with the lease time.
- Kill python processes that have passed their deadline.
- MARKETING SITE.  possibly blog posts etc.
