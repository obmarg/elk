### Must have

- Logging python processes
- Python virtualenv support (and installing dependencies to the virtualenv)
- Figure out how to package python files.
- Tests, if I can figure out how best to write them.

### Good stuff

- Better taks failure handling
  - Backoff on failing tasks
  - Store details of fully failed tasks

### Nice to have

- Add a deadline to python tasks, co-ordinated with the lease time.
- Kill python processes that have passed their deadline.
- MARKETING SITE.  possibly blog posts etc.
